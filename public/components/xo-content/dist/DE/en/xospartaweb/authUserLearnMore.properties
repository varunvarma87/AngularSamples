xospartaweb.authUserLearnMore.authUserContentPara1=For this transaction, your merchant has requested an authorization for the amount of your payment. With your consent, the merchant may change your final payment amount if the total amount changes, due to taxes, shipping charges, item availability, or other conditions that you agree upon with your merchant.

In some cases, you may receive a hold on your PayPal balance that is not immediately transferred to the merchant upon completing your authorization. Your money wonâ€™t be transferred to the merchant until the merchant processes your payment.
