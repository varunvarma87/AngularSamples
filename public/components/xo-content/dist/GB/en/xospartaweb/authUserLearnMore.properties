xospartaweb.authUserLearnMore.authUserTitle=Why is my payment being processed later?
xospartaweb.authUserLearnMore.authUserContentPara1=For this transaction, your merchant has requested an authorisation for the amount of your payment. With your consent, the merchant may change your final payment amount if the total amount changes, due to VAT, delivery charges, item availability or other conditions that you agree upon with the merchant.
xospartaweb.authUserLearnMore.authUserContentPara2=A payment that you authorise to a merchant is valid for a variable period. In some cases, you may receive a hold on your PayPal balance that is not immediately transferred to the merchant upon completing your authorisation. Your money wonâ€™t be transferred to the merchant until the merchant processes your payment.
