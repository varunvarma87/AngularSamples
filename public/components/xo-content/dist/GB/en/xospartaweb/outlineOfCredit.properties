xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.isPayPalCreditSuitableQuestion=<strong>Is PayPal Online Credit suitable for the type of credit you are looking for?</strong>
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.isPayPalCreditSuitableAnswer=PayPal Credit is a revolving credit product and would be an expensive way to borrow large amounts over a long period. When making an application for a PayPal credit account, you are applying for Online Credit. Please note you will only be offered one of these products, depending on your credit score. It is important that you read the information provided to determine if PayPal Credit is suitable for your needs.
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.repayUnderCreditQuestion=<strong>How much will I have to repay under the Credit Agreement?</strong>
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.repayUnderCreditAnswer=The total amount you have to repay will depend on how much you spend using your PayPal Credit and how much of the outstanding balance you repay each month. You can pay off as much of the balance each month as you would like, but you must pay at least the minimum payment set out in your statement each month before the date shown there. Details of how this is calculated are set out in your pre-contract information. If you do not pay off the whole balance owed every month, you will be charged interest, which could mean it will take you longer, and cost you more, to repay the full balance.
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.noRepaymentQuestion=<strong>What are the consequences for me if I do not keep up with repayments?</strong>
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.noRepaymentAnswer=It is important that you make at least the minimum payment when it is due. Failure to make the minimum monthly payment on time will result in a late payment fee of £12. Other interest may be charged. As a consequence of this, the total cost of your debt may grow. If you don't make your payments on time, we are entitled to record any defaults that you make at credit reference agencies. This may make obtaining credit more difficult and more expensive in the future. We may also be entitled to move funds from your PayPal account Wallet to settle any outstanding payments. It could also result in legal action being taken against you, by us, or a third party to whom we may have sold the debt, which could result in a court order being obtained and you incurring legal costs. A court order may result in any outstanding debt being secured against your home.
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.withdrawCreditAgreementQuestion=<strong>What rights do I have to withdraw from the Credit Agreement once I have entered into it?</strong>
xospartaweb.outlineOfCredit.withdrawCreditAgreementAnswer=If you decide that you no longer want your new PayPal Credit, you have 14 days from the day after you receive confirmation of PayPal Credit to tell us you want to withdraw from the Credit Agreement. If you want to withdraw, you must tell us before the end of this time by writing to us at PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. Société en Commandite par Actions.
